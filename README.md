# Simple CRUD with TypeScript, Express, and MySQL

Hello! üëã This is a repository where I'm developing a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using TypeScript, Express, and MySQL. This project started as a practical exercise to hone my understanding of these technologies.

## About the Project

This project is a simple backend application that provides basic CRUD operations. It's still a work in progress, so feel free to contribute with ideas!

## Technologies Used

* TypeScript - a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and class-based objects.
* Express - a minimalistic and flexible framework for Node.js web applications.
* MySQL - one of the most popular database management systems in the world.

## Contributions
